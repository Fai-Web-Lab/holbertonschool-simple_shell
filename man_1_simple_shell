.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1
.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.br
.B ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a basic UNIX command line interpreter that reads
commands from standard input and executes them.

The shell operates in both interactive and non-interactive modes.
In interactive mode, it displays a prompt and waits for the user to
enter a command. In non-interactive mode, it reads commands from
standard input without displaying a prompt.

The shell reads a line of input, parses it into tokens, and executes
the corresponding command by creating a child process using
.BR fork (2)
and executing the command with
.BR execve (2).
The parent process waits for the child process to terminate.

.SH MODES
.TP
.B Interactive mode
The shell displays a prompt and waits for user input. The prompt
is displayed again after each command execution.

.TP
.B Non-interactive mode
The shell reads commands from standard input, such as from a pipe
or file.

Example:
.br
echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
The shell executes commands using the following steps:
.IP 1.
Read a line from standard input.
.IP 2.
Parse the line into command and arguments.
.IP 3.
Check for built-in commands.
.IP 4.
Search for the command in the PATH if needed.
.IP 5.
Create a child process using fork.
.IP 6.
Execute the command using execve.
.IP 7.
Wait for the child process to finish.

.SH BUILTINS
The following built-in commands are supported:

.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell. No arguments are required or handled.

.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables.

.SH PATH HANDLING
If the command does not contain a slash (/), the shell searches
for the executable in the directories listed in the PATH
environment variable.

If the command contains a slash, it is executed directly without
searching the PATH.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of the last executed command is returned by the shell.

A successful command returns an exit status of 0.

If a command cannot be found, the shell returns an exit status of 127.

Built-in commands return 0 on success and a non-zero value on failure.

.SH ERRORS
If an executable cannot be found, an error message is printed to
standard error and the shell continues running.

The shell handles the end-of-file condition (Ctrl+D) by exiting
gracefully.
